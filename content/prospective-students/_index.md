        Mentorship Philosophy
      text: |
        I started my journey as an Arctic scientist as an undergraduate with the Polaris Project. Through my experiences as a young scientist working in eastern Siberia, I had the opportunity to work with academic and research mentors that thoughtfully guided me through the ups and downs of field work and research. They showed me the ropes, instilled a sense of confidence in me, and taught me about the vulnerable northern ecosystems that are facing rapid changes due to climate change. 
        <br>
        
        I have been lucky enough to have been surrounded by incredible mentors from undergrad through my PhD experience and as a postdoctoral fellow. The relationships I formed with my mentors was the number one factor that led me to pursuit a career in Arctic Science. Now, as a mentor myself, my goal is to give back to the next generation of scientists through mentoring undergraduate and graduate students. I especially enjoy bringing students to the field and helping them develop their own research projects and interests. One of my mentorship philosophies is to prepare students with the relevant background and methodological skillsets they need to learn how to ask questions and learn how to connect background information to the discoveries they make in the field. The joy of discovery and making connections is one of the best aspects of research to me.

        Prospective Graduate Students
      text: |
        Information about the graduate programs (M.Sc., Ph.D.) can be found [here](https://geog.ubc.ca/graduate/masters-programs/msc-geography/). The Geography Department typically requires students hold an M.Sc. degree before starting a Ph.D. program. Our M.Sc. degrees are 2 years long and our Ph.D. degrees are typically completed in 4-5 years.
        
        <b><u> Admissions Timeline: </u></b> The deadline for M.Sc. applications is typically around December 15th while the deadline for Ph.D. applications is around January 10th. Please check the [department website](https://geog.ubc.ca/graduate/) for up-to-date deadlines. If you are interested in applying, please reach out to Dr. Kuhn 3-12 months before the applications deadline. The earlier the better!
