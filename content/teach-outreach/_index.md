        Mentorship Philosophy
      text: |
        <center> 
        I started my journey as an Arctic scientist as an undergraduate with the Polaris Project. Through my experiences as a young scientist working in eastern Siberia, I had the opportunity to work with academic and research mentors that thoughtfully guided me through the ups and downs of field work and research. They showed me the ropes, instilled a sense of confidence in me, and taught me about the vulnerable northern ecosystems that are facing rapid changes due to climate change.

        I have been lucky enough to have been surrounded by incredible mentors from undergrad through my PhD experience and as a postdoctoral fellow. The relationships I formed with my mentors was the number one factor that led me to pursuit a career in Arctic Science. Now, as a mentor myself, my goal is to give back to the next generation of scientists through mentoring undergraduate and graduate students. I especially enjoy bringing students to the field and helping them develop their own research projects and interests. One of my mentorship philosophies is to prepare students with the relevant background and methodological skillsets they need to learn how to ask questions and learn how to connect background information to the discoveries they make in the field. The joy of discovery and making connections is one of the best aspects of research to me.

        <u> GEOG497 </u> <br> The Arctic
      text: |
        This course is designed to foster knowledge and discussion around the ecological and societal realities of a changing Arctic, which is warming at a rate at least four times that of the rest of the globe. Increases in Arctic air temperatures and changes to the cryosphere (e.g., loss of permafrost, sea ice, and glaciers) threaten ecosystems across the globe due to feedbacks within the Earth system, including accelerated global climate warming. The changing Arctic creates complex challenges for human communities in the far north including issues of environmental change, governance, infrastructure, human health, and Indigenous rights. Students will explore issues related to the central question of the course: what are the impacts of climate change on Arctic ecosystems and humans?
        <br>
        This course focuses on the physical and biological characteristics of the Arctic, emphasizing the terrestrial landscape and the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and humans. This includes topics ranging from glacial history to climatology; biogeography/ecology of Arctic ecosystems; climate change disturbances, human-environment interactions; history of settlement; resource extraction; and current environmental, social, and economic problems in the Canadian North. The main objectives of this course are for students to gain an understanding of the human and biogeographic histories of the Canadian North and the current impacts of climate change on ecosystems and society, including an appreciation for what is and isn’t known about the rapidly changing Arctic.

        <u> GEOS102 </u> <br> Our Changing Environment: Climate and Ecosystems 
      text: |
        <br> 
        This course provides an introduction to climatology and biogeography. I teach the climatology section of the course. Climatology is the study of the heat and moisture states of the Earth’s surface and atmosphere. In this course, we explore the structure of the atmosphere, global wind and climate patterns, severe weather, and the underlying causes and consequences of climate warming.
