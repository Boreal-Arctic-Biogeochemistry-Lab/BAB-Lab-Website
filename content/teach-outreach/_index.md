        GEOG497 - the Arctic
      text: |
        This course is designed to foster knowledge and discussion around the ecological and societal realities of a changing Arctic, which is warming at a rate at least four times that of the rest of the globe. Increases in Arctic air temperatures and changes to the cryosphere (e.g., loss of permafrost, sea ice, and glaciers) threaten ecosystems across the globe due to feedbacks within the Earth system, including accelerated global climate warming. The changing Arctic creates complex challenges for human communities in the far north including issues of environmental change, governance, infrastructure, human health, and Indigenous rights. Students will explore issues related to the central question of the course: what are the impacts of climate change on Arctic ecosystems and humans?
        <br>
        This course focuses on the physical and biological characteristics of the Arctic, emphasizing the terrestrial landscape and the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and humans. This includes topics ranging from glacial history to climatology; biogeography/ecology of Arctic ecosystems; climate change disturbances, human-environment interactions; history of settlement; resource extraction; and current environmental, social, and economic problems in the Canadian North. The main objectives of this course are for students to gain an understanding of the human and biogeographic histories of the Canadian North and the current impacts of climate change on ecosystems and society, including an appreciation for what is and isn’t known about the rapidly changing Arctic.

        GEOS102 - Our Changing Environment: Climate and Ecosystems
      text: |
        This course provides an introduction to climatology and biogeography. I teach the climatology section of the course. Climatology is the study of the heat and moisture states of the Earth’s surface and atmosphere. In this course, we explore the structure of the atmosphere, global wind and climate patterns, severe weather, and the underlying causes and consequences of climate warming.
