I am a biogeochemist and physical geographer with interests in carbon and nutrient cycling in northern boreal and Arctic ecosystems.  From northern Sweden to western boreal Canada, I look to understand how climate change, including warming temperatures, wildfire, and permafrost thaw, will impact northern ecosystems. In my new role at UBC, I am most excited to share my love for northern research through mentoring undergraduate and graduate students. In my free time I love to explore the great outdoors via waterways and cycling.
