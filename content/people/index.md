        I am a biogeochemist and physical geographer with interests in carbon and nutrient cycling in northern boreal and Arctic ecosystems.  From northern Sweden to western boreal Canada, I look to understand how climate change, including warming temperatures, wildfire, and permafrost thaw, will impact northern ecosystems. In my new role at UBC, I am most excited to share my love for northern research through mentoring undergraduate and graduate students. In my free time I love to explore the great outdoors via waterways and cycling.

        I am pursuing a Masters of Science within the lab, where my thesis aims to understand how aquatic, mainly submerged and emergent, vegetation alters Methane dynamics in Kaska (Northern British Columbia) lakes. Before entering the lab, I earned a BSc in Geographical Sciences from the University of British Columbia. Outside of school, you can often find me listening to some music, curled up with a book, and staying out of the pesky Vancouver rain.
